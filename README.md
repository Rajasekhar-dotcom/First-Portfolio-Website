**First Step into Web Development!**



I’m excited to share that I’ve just built my portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript marking the first step in my web development journey.



This project was a great opportunity to strengthen my fundamentals in front-end development and understand how structure, style, and interactivity come together to create a cohesive user experience.



I also experimented with AI tools to refine and tweak parts of the design and honestly, it was such a game-changer.

 

This is just the beginning, and I’m looking forward to deepening my skills, exploring new technologies, and building impactful projects along the way.



Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on improving the portfolio always open to feedback!
